# Mars Rover

## Assignment Requirements

For this "Mars Rover" assignment, you must accomplish the following:

1. Use unit testing to validate the behavior of the constructor within an
   existing class.
1. Use test driven development (TDD) to guide the creation of new classes and
   methods.

## How Your Assignment is Graded

First, your TA is going to check your code.
They are looking to see if you have properly coded the `Message` class so that the tests pass.
They will then turn their attention to the `Rover` class. Here, you need to complete the tests for the `Rover` class and add some functionality to the class itself. 

After they review your code, they will run the code as-is to verify that you have completed all the tests and that all the tests pass. You should have 14 tests that pass.

### Grading Tests

After these initial checks, your TA will run the tests inside `studentgrade.specx.js`. You may have noticed this file already, but this file only contains grading tests for your TA to use.
If you would like to see if your work will pass the grading tests, run the tests inside that file by changing the extension to `spec.js`. 

When you are ready, submit the link to your github repository link in Canvas!
